some advanced use of pandas
demo of using global and nonlocal variables(in "renew_case").
in request_api, there is some prediction problems related to: 
when changing the project state of a patient, it will also change the old state of the patient. 
i manage this problem by switching the old state of the patient. it works like changing the group categories from(1, 2) to (1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1).
